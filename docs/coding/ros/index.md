## Introduction

ROS aka Robotic Operating System is not a OS itself but a framework and middleware.

- Software Framework for programming robots
- Prototype from Standfort AI Research Institute and created by Willow Garage in 2007
- Since 2013 maintained by the Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF)
- Consists of infrastrucutre, tools, capabilities and a ecosystem

| Advantages                                              | Disadvantages                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Provides lots of infrastructure, tools and capabilities | Approaching maturity, but still changing              |
| Easy to try other people's work and share your own      | Security and scalability are not first-class concerns |
| Large community                                         | OSes other than Ubuntu Linux are not well supported   |
| Free, open source, BSD license                          |                                                       |
| **Great for open-source and researchers**               | **Not great for mission-critical tasks**              |

### Philosophy

- **Peer to peer** - Individual programs communicate over defined API (ROS messages, services, etc.).
- **Distributed** - Programs can be run on multiple computers and communicate over the network.
- **Multi-lingual** - ROS modules can be written in any language for which a client library exists (C++, Python, MATLAB, Java, etc.).
- **Thin** - The ROS conventions encourage contributors to create standalone libraries and then wrap those libraries so they can send and receive messages to and from other ROS modules.
- **Free and open source** - The core of ROS is released under the permissive BSD license, which allows commercial and noncommercial use.
