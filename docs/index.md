# Welcome to my (0,0,0)

This webpage is a compilation of information that I aimed to learn at various points in time. It is a work in progress and may not yet meet high-quality standards. Through years of experience, I've discovered that creating summaries and cheat sheets about a topic is the most effective way to learn and assimilate knowledge.

This collection originated on paper around 1999 and transitioned into a webpage format in 2004. It has undergone significant transformations, initially using Dokuwiki, then Sphinx, and now MKDocs.

Feel free to explore the content, if it proves beneficial to others, that's even better.
