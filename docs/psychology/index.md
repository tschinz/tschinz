# Psychology

![](img/logo.svg){.center width="20%"}

My take on various psychological concepts and theories, such as communication, management, leadership and decision-making.

The information about psychology is based on my personal experiences, readings, and observations. I am not a psychologist, but I find the field of psychology fascinating and believe that understanding human behavior and thought processes can help us navigate life more effectively. A list of curated books which are the basis of these following pages can be found [here](../multimedia/books/index.md#psychology).
