# Fast Friends Procedure

![](img/fastfriendprocedure.svg){.center width="20%"}

This was developed by psychologist Arthur Aron and his colleagues in 1997. The procedure consists of 36 questions divided into three sets, each set designed to increase the level of vulnerability and intimacy between two people. The questions are meant to be asked in a specific order, with each set building on the previous one.

See [GGIA Berkley](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/36_questions_for_increasing_closeness) for more information.

- Start with shallow, safe questions
- Gradually increase the depth and vulnerability of the questions

## Time required
45 minutes each time you do this practice.

## How to do it

1. Identify someone with whom you’d like to become closer. It could be someone you know well or someone you’re just getting to know. Although this exercise has a reputation for making people fall in love, it is actually useful for anyone you want to feel close to, including family members, friends, and acquaintances. Before trying it, make sure both you and your partner are comfortable with sharing personal thoughts and feelings with each other.
2. Find a time when you and your partner have at least 45 minutes free and are able to meet in person.
3. For 15 minutes, take turns asking one another the questions in Set I below. Each person should answer each question, but in an alternating order, so that a different person goes first each time.
4. After 15 minutes, move on to Set II, even if you haven’t yet finished the Set I questions. Then spend 15 minutes on Set II, following the same system.
5. After 15 minutes on Set II, spend 15 minutes on Set III.
